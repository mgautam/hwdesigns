1. Removing any sync signal turns the display off
2. Removing color (RGB) signals doesnot turn off the display
3. If 2(R,G) color signals are floating and the 3rd(B) one is connected, the 3rd(B) color is displayed.
4. We can mix and match colors by coneecting combination of r,g,b signals
5. If vga connector is completely unplugged, the screen detects it and "check signal cable" error is displayed.
6. When screen's R,G or B wire is connected to fpga output, voltage significantly drops. This happens even when 3.3v-5v level shifters are used.
7. The bitstream doesn't configure the FCLK clocks and PLL's at all. This is done by the ps7_init functions in the hw_platform and FSBL. So if you want to change the FCLK_CLK0 frequency you must rebuild the FSBL, rebuild boot.bin and copy it to SD-card or QSPI (or whatever you boot from).
